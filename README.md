This project provided an opportunity to explore clean, semantic HTML and modern CSS features while delivering educational content through a smooth, user-centered interface. It serves both as a creative outlet and as a refined exercise in UI/UX fundamentals.

## 🙏 Acknowledgment

This project was developed as part of the **SheCodes Basics Add-on** workshop. While not my first foray into web development, this challenge allowed me to sharpen my existing front-end skills and pay closer attention to design aesthetics, responsive behavior, and interactive elements such as theme toggling.

**Special thanks to the [SheCodes team](https://www.shecodes.io/) and the [Delacs Foundation](https://www.delac.foundation/)** for their support and commitment to empowering women in tech through accessible and impactful learning experiences.
